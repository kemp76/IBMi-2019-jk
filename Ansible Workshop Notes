IBM Ansible Course 2021-09-20

Ansible Engine usually installed on Linux. Full support on RHEL 

Ansible Tower is a front end GUI 


Inventory File 
	is a list of hosts
	with Grouping 
	and parameters, (eg. connection settings)
					(eg. which Python interpreter)
					
Can add parameters which applies to all instances 

Telling Ansible where the Inventory file is
	several ways, but the '-i option' is recommended
	
.cfg configuration file used to determine many parameters
ansible.cfg name of file, looks through several locations, finally looking here: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
best just to use the above location
command: ansible --version 
	shows where the cfg file is
	
Python Modules
These are Idempotent, so can be run repeatedly without consequences
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/

Ping module connects to hosts, validates Python is working and returns 'pong' if successful

ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=minimal	
allows a lot of information to be passed back for example SETUP


PLAYBOOKS
Usually we don't execute Ansible commands from commandline, we run them from Playbooks
	in YAML format
	An instruction for what to config to execute remotely
'atom' is a development environment which understands the yaml layout

Stu keps his madules & playbooks on GitHub

Tags & Tasks can be used to categorise tasks

Variables can be defined in a 'copybook' .yaml file and be pulled in using 'include_vars:' code

vars_prompt is used to define variables which will be promptable,prompt: is used to define text displayed when prompting

default variable type is string
other types cn be defined specifically

Facts vs Variables
Variables are updated every time they are used but a fact is not

Loops
Anything with 'with_' at the start is a loop

command "delegate_to:" localhost would set the connection to run locally

Roles
This is a collection of playbooks
So can split a large playbook into smaller chunks. 
Variable definitions can be taken out and placed in a role too
A role is a folder containing other yaml file
Within roles directory there are subfolders
one for example is vars
in here main.yml is the default variable 'copybook' pulled in when executing the copybook
TASKS is the main subfolder here which is used when using the IMPORT function within another copybook
The other subfolders can be removed if unused

Default concurrancy is 5 simultaneous hostconnections
Some Ansible users change this down or up
16 works fine apparently
